Predicting Myriad Diseases From a Single Drop of Blood,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, July 23, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A single drop of blood might be able to predict the onset of dozens of diseases, a new study claims.

Analysis of the protein “signatures” in a droplet of blood can predict 67 diseases, including blood cancers, degenerative nerve diseases, lung disease and heart failure, researchers reported July 22 in the journal Nature Medicine.

For the study, researchers analyzed the blood proteins of more than 40,000 randomly selected participants in the ongoing UK Biobank study.

Looking at the participants’ electronic health records, researchers pinpointed 5 to 20 proteins most closely associated with each disease.

These protein “signatures” outperformed other standard tests that used measures like blood cell counts, cholesterol levels, kidney function and blood sugar levels to predict the 67 diseases, researchers report.

“Several of our protein signatures performed similar or even better than proteins already trialled for their potential as screening tests, such as prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer,” said lead researcher Julia Carrasco Zanini Sanchez, a postdoctoral researcher with the Precision Healthcare University Research Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

“We are therefore extremely excited about the opportunities that our protein signatures may have for earlier detection and ultimately improved prognosis for many diseases,” Sanchez added in a university news release.

Such a simple blood test could not only improve early detection of diseases, but might also help in the search for new medicines, said senior researcher Robert Scott, vice president and head of human genetics and genomics at the pharmaceutical company GSK.

“A key challenge in drug development is the identification of patients most likely to benefit from new medicines,” Scott said.

Protein blood tests could be used “to identify individuals at high risk across a wide range of diseases, and aligns with our approach to use tech to deepen our understanding of human biology and disease,” Scott added.

However, the researchers said their findings need to be validated in different groups of people, including folks from different ethnic groups and with varying levels of symptoms for different diseases.

Scientists May Have Stopped a Form of Inherited Blindness in Dogs,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, July 22, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- In her youth, Shola, an English Shepherd Dog, was a member of the Edale Mountain Rescue Team, a corps of U.K. pooches charged with helping hurt and stranded hikers.

But Shola was retired as part of the Rescue Team after a rare genetic disease affecting dogs, called progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), robbed her of her sight.

It's too late for Shola, but new research has led to a gene test that could prevent the disease from ever being passed down to puppies -- perhaps someday eliminating PRA from dog populations for good.

“Once the dog’s eyesight starts to fail, there’s no treatment – it will end up totally blind,” explained study first author Dr. Katherine Stanbury, a veterinary researcher at the University of Cambridge.

Often an owner may not even realize their dog has PRA until middle-age, long after puppy breeding may have occurred.

However, “now we have a DNA test, there’s no reason why another English Shepherd Dog ever needs to be born with this form of progressive retinal atrophy – it gives breeders a way of totally eliminating the disease,"" Stanbury said in a Cambridge news release.

The key was pinpointing which gene or genes led to the vision-robbing condition.

Stanbury's team did so by comparing DNA samples from six English Shepherds with PRA and 20 without it.

The Cambridge group was already well situated for this kind of research, because they offer a service that helps dog owners make sure breeding doesn't produce puppies with troublesome genes.

They quickly spotted the gene driving PRA in English Shepherds, and then devised a commercial mouth-swab test that helps owners determine if their dog carries this DNA.

The gene in question is recessive, meaning that both the male and female dog involved in breeding must carry the gene before it can trigger PRA in a puppy.

But since dogs are very inbred, the odds of that happening are much higher than among species such as humans, the Cambridge team noted.

However, “for the price of a decent bag of dog food people can now have their English Shepherd tested for Progressive Retinal Atrophy prior to breeding,"" said senior study author and Cambridge veterinary researcher Dr. Cathryn Mellersh.

'It’s about prevention, rather than a cure, and it means a huge amount to the people who breed these dogs,"" she added. ""They no longer need to worry about whether the puppies are going to be healthy or are going to develop this horrible disease in a few years’ time.”

The Cambridge group noted that PRA is closely related to an eye disease found in people called retinitis pigmentosa, so insights into human vision loss may arise from this research.

As for Shola, although she's no longer rescuing stranded hikers, her daughters are clear of PRA and just completed training with Mountain Rescue Search Dogs England. In fact, ""one of them saved a man’s life three weeks ago,"" according to the Cambridge news release.

The study was published July 21 in the journal Genes.

Too Many Breast Cancer Survivors Miss Out on Genetic Screening,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

FRIDAY, July 19, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Many breast cancer patients aren’t getting genetic counseling and testing that could help them get the most effective treatment, a new study finds.

Only three-quarters of patients eligible for genetic testing after their breast cancer diagnosis actually received it, researchers reported July 15 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Further, just over half of breast cancer survivors eligible for testing during follow-up care received a genetic screening.

“Our findings support a rapidly growing movement to simplify clinical guidelines to increase access to genetic testing and clinical impact of the results after diagnosis and into survivorship,” said lead researcher Dr. Steven Katz, a professor of internal medicine and of health management and policy at the University of Michigan.

Certain genetic mutations can increase a woman’s risk for breast cancer, the American Cancer Society says. The best-known are BRCA gene mutations, which cause 5% to 10% of breast cancers and for which specific treatments have been developed.

Genetic tests can help guide treatment, as well as follow-up care and screening, researchers said. The results can also be used to warn other family members of potential increased risk for cancer.

For this study, researchers surveyed more than 1,400 women at seven months and at six years after they were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.

The team found many women aren’t getting the gene testing for which they’re eligible, both at diagnosis and following treatment.

“Genetic risk evaluation and testing can fall through the cracks during survivorship as patients’ needs for ongoing treatments, managing the side effects of treatments and monitoring for recurrence or progression grow,” senior researcher Lauren Wallner, an associate professor of internal medicine and epidemiology at Michigan, said in a university news release.

At the same time, about a third of patients for whom genetic testing wouldn’t be recommended got it anyway, results showed.

There was some good news -- among those who got testing, nearly two-thirds who had a genetic variant reached out to family members to talk about their results, researchers said.

Results also showed that few people are interested in direct-to-consumer genetic tests, which are not as sophisticated as genetic testing and counseling at hospitals and clinics, researchers said.

Current Gene Screens Miss Many at High Cancer Risk: Study,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, July 19, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- As good as many genetic tests might be, a deeper look at the DNA of over 44,000 people identified many who carried genes that hike their risks for cancer, researchers said.

""This study is a wake-up call, showing us that current national guidelines for genetic screenings are missing too many people at high risk of cancer,"" said lead author Dr. Niloy Jewel Samadder. He's a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist at the Center for Individualized Medicine and the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.

""Early detection of genetic markers for these conditions can lead to proactive screenings and targeted therapies, potentially saving lives of people and their family members,"" Samadder said in a Mayo Clinic news release.

The study is part of the Tapestry project at the Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine. This research initiative goes beyond the genome to look at each patient's exome -- the protein-coding regions of individual genes.

The project has already sequenced the exomes of more than 100,000 patients, Mayo noted in a news release.

In the latest study, Samadder and his colleagues focused on the exome because it is the most likely area for mutations that give rise to disease.

They looked at the exomes of over 44,000 people of varying backgrounds and found that 550 of them -- about 1.24% -- did carry a hereditary genetic mutation that upped their odds for either breast and/or ovarian cancers or Lynch syndrome, a condition that raises the odds for endometrial and colorectal cancers.

More than half of the people identified as carrying these mutations previously had no idea they were were at risk, and 40% would not have even met the criteria for genetic testing, the authors noted.

Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have long been known to raise a person's odds for breast and ovarian cancers. As Samadder's team noted, carrying BRCA1 confers a 60% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 40% risk of getting ovarian cancer.

BRCA2 mutations confer a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of 50% and ovarian cancer of 20%, with additional risks for prostate and pancreatic cancers in men.

Having Lynch syndrome confers an 80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer and 50% risk of uterine/endometrial cancers.

The findings were published July 16 in the journal JCO Precision Oncology.

According to the researchers, minority groups may especially miss out when it comes to screening for genes that raise cancer risks.

""Existing guidelines for genetic testing inadvertently introduce biases that affect who qualifies for testing and who receives coverage through health insurance,"" Samadder said. ""Our results emphasize the importance of expanding genetic screening to identify people at risk for these cancer predisposition syndromes.""

Thinking of a Switch Away from Meat? Your Genes May Be Key,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, July 15, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Pondering a move to a vegetarian or vegan diet? Your heart might be in it, but your genes might not, a new study says.

Genetics are an important part of whether a person responds well or poorly to a vegetarian diet, researchers said.

People with a specific genetic variant can see increased calcium levels after going vegetarian, which typically results in decreased calcium for most, researchers report in the journal PLOS Genetics.

Likewise, another variant saw increased testosterone levels, which typically decline in a majority of vegetarians, researchers said.

But a third variant could cause vegetarians to suffer a decline in kidney function, which usually improves on a plant-based diet, researchers said.

“People with specific and immediate nutritional requirements related to these three traits should consider being tested for the variants we describe in this manuscript and making changes accordingly,” lead researcher Michael Francis, a doctoral graduate of the University of Georgia’s Institute of Bioinformatics, said in a news release.

Francis himself was a vegetarian for seven years in his teens and 20s, but now eats meat as part of his diet.

For the study, researchers analyzed data for more than 150,000 people, identifying 2,300 who followed a strict vegetarian diet.

They found that in general vegetarians have low levels of cholesterol, which is good for heart health.

But a vegetarian diet also is linked to lower vitamin D levels, which can affect bone health and immune function, researchers noted. Vegetarians also have higher levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that can contribute to heart disease.

Ultimately, researchers concluded that genetics play an important role in diet, so much so that in the future each person might need to follow a highly personalized diet in order to achieve their best health.

“We are building a scientific foundation for personalized nutrition, which optimizes human health at the level of the individual, instead of one-size-fits-all dietary recommendations,” Francis said.

Some Genes Might Send Girls Into Puberty Earlier,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, July 2, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A girl’s genetics can indirectly influence the age when she has her first period, by accelerating her weight gain in childhood, a new study finds.

A number of other genes also can directly affect the age of puberty, some with profound effects, researchers added.

More than 1,000 genetic variants are tied to the age of a girl’s first menstrual period, researchers discovered by analyzing the genes of about 800,000 women. About 600 of these variants were observed for the first time in this study.

A girl can have up to 14-fold higher risk of early puberty if her genetics line up that way, according to a genetic risk score researchers created from their findings.

“This is the first time we’ve ever been able to analyze rare genetic variants at this scale,” said lead researcher Katherine Kentistou, a senior research associate with the University of Cambridge’s Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit.

“We have identified six genes which all profoundly affect the timing of puberty,” she said in a news release. “While these genes were discovered in girls, they often have the same impact on the timing of puberty in boys. The new mechanisms we describe could form the basis of interventions for individuals at risk of early puberty and obesity.”

Girls typically enter puberty typically between 10 and 15 years of age, but this has been getting earlier and earlier in recent decades.

Early puberty is linked with increased risk for many diseases later in life, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers, researchers said in background notes. On the other hand, later puberty has been linked to better adult health and longer lifespan.

In the study, researchers found that 45% of the gene variants that affect puberty do so indirectly by increasing weight gain in youngsters.

“Many of the genes we’ve found influence early puberty by first accelerating weight gain in infants and young children. This can then lead to potentially serious health problems in later life, as having earlier puberty leads to higher rates of overweight and obesity in adulthood,” researcher John Perry, an investigator with the University of Cambridge Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, said in a news release.

The team also analyzed rare genetic variants that can have a large effect on puberty.

For example, a variant in the gene ZNF483 can cause women to experience puberty an average 1.3 years later. About 1 in 3,800 women carry this variant, researchers said.

The team also created a genetic score that could predict whether a girl was likely to hit puberty very early or very late.

Girls with the highest 1% of this genetic score were 11 times more likely to reach puberty after age 15, which researchers described as extremely delayed.

Likewise, girls with the lowest 1% genetic score were 14 times more likely to have extremely early puberty before age 10.

“In the future, we may be able to use these genetic scores in the clinic to identify those girls whose puberty will come very early or very late,” senior researcher Ken Ong, an investigator with the University of Cambridge Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, said in a news release.

Girls who present with very early puberty can be offered puberty blockers to delay its onset, he said.

“But age of puberty is a continuum, and if they miss this threshold, there’s currently nothing we have to offer,” Ong said. “We need other interventions, whether that’s oral medication or a behavioral approach, to help. This could be important for their health when they grow up.”

The new study was published July 1 in the journal Nature Genetics.

Colombian Family's Genes Could Hold Key to Delaying Alzheimer's,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, June 20, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A Colombian family’s genetics are shining a spotlight on a gene that might help protect people from the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease.

About 1,200 out of 6,000 family members carry a genetic variant called the “Paisa mutation,” which dooms them to early Alzheimer’s, researchers said.

But 28 family members with the Paisa mutation dodged early Alzheimer’s, apparently because they carry another gene that protects against the degenerative brain disease, researchers reported June 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The study represents the first evidence that having this other gene -- known as the “Christchurch variant” -- might confer some protection against inherited Alzheimer’s, researchers said.

Drugs and therapies focusing on this genetic pathway might be capable of preventing or treating dementia and Alzheimer’s in others, said co-lead author Yakeel Quiroz, director of the Familial Dementia Neuroimaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital.

“As a clinician, I am highly encouraged by our findings, as they suggest the potential for delaying cognitive decline and dementia in older individuals,” Quiroz said in a hospital news release. “Now we must leverage this new knowledge to develop effective treatments for dementia prevention.”

The study focused on variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene.

The APOE4 variant is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s, and is linked to developing a more severe form of dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.

On the other hand, the APOE3 gene variant has until now not seemed to have any affect on the risk of Alzheimer’s.

But in 2019, researchers found that a woman in the Colombian family who carried two copies of a specific APO3 variant developed cognitive impairment three decades later than expected.

Most people with the Paisa mutation develop mild cognitive impairment in their 40s, dementia in their 50s and die from dementia complications in their 60s.

But this woman carried the APO3 “Christchurch” variant, and subsequently didn’t develop brain problems until her late 70s.

For the new study, researchers dug into the medical history of the Colombian family to see if any other members benefited from the Christchurch variant.

Analyzing nearly 1,100 descendants of the Colombian family, researchers identified 27 additional members who carried one copy of the Christchurch variant as well as the Paisa mutation.

These 27 family members all experienced delayed onset of dementia and Alzheimer’s.

They began showing signs of cognitive impairment at age 52, on average, compared to age 47 for family members without the Christchurch variant. They also showed signs of dementia four years later than other relatives.

This is important because it shows that preventing Alzheimer’s through the Christchurch variant is possible, said co-senior study author Dr. Joseph Arboleda-Velasquez, an associate scientist at Mass Eye and Ear.

“Our original study told us that protection was possible, and that was an important insight. But if a person needs two copies of a rare genetic variant, it just comes down to luck,"" Arboleda-Velasquez said.

“Our new study is significant because it increases our confidence that this target is not only protective, but druggable,” Arboleda-Velasquez added. “We think that therapeutics inspired by protected humans are much more likely to work and to be safer.”

Brain scans and autopsies showed that people with the Christchurch variant had healthier blood vessels, lower levels of tau protein and preserved activity in brain regions typically involved in Alzheimer’s disease.

Further studies involving larger and more ethnically diverse groups could shed more light on the protective effect of the Christchurch variant, and determine if it could translate into treatments for Alzheimer’s, the researchers concluded.

“As a next step, we are currently focused on improving our understanding of the brain resilience among the remaining family members who carry one copy of the Christchurch variant,” Quiroz said. “This involves conducting structural and functional MRI scans and cognitive evaluations, as well as analyzing blood samples to assess their protein and biomarker profiles.”

Another Study Finds CRISPR Gene Therapy Fights Sickle Cell,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, June 18, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- There's more good news in the battle against sickle cell disease, with another trial finding CRISPR gene-editing therapy delivering impressive results for patients.

“It’s encouraging that this gene-editing treatment continues to show promising efficacy for sickle cell patients,” said study lead investigator Dr. Rabi Hanna. He's chair of the division of pediatric hematology oncology and blood and marrow transplantation at Cleveland Clinic Children’s.

Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited genetic disorder which creates misshapen sickle-shaped red blood cells. Over 100,000 Americans are thought to have sickle cell disease, which can shorten life spans and is much more common among Black Americans.

Recent advances in what's known as CRISPR gene-editing technology helps correct the disorder by tweaking the underlying gene abnormality behind it.

The Cleveland Clinic CRISPR approach is called renizgamglogene autogedtemcel (shortened to ""reni-cel""). It's am experimental one-time treatment that uses the patient's own stem cells to correct the genetic abnormality.

Two of the 18 patients in the new trial were treated at the Cleveland Clinic.

In the procedure, patients' stem cells are harvested and then sent for gene editing in the lab. Patients also underwent chemotherapy to make room for the new stem cells to be infused into their bone marrow.

""Following treatment, all patients successfully regained their white blood cells and platelets,"" according to a clinic news release. ""Importantly, all patients have remained free of painful events since treatment, and those followed for five months or greater have seen their anemia resolve.""

The treatment also appeared to have no serious side effects, Hanna's group reported.

""These latest results offer hope that this new experimental treatment will continue to show progress and get us closer to a functional cure for this devastating disease,"" he said.

The findings were presented Thursday at the European Hematology Association 2024 Hybrid Congress (EHA) in Madrid. Such findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The trial was funded by gene-editing company Editas Medicine.

Inherited Alzheimer's: Whether It's From Mom or Dad Could Matter,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, June 17, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Genetics can play a role in a person's odds for Alzheimer's disease, and new research suggests differences in that risk are based on which parent had the illness.

In a study of 4,400 people still ""cognitively unimpaired,"" there was higher buildup of amyloid protein plaques in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer's) if either the person's mother, or both parents, had Alzheimer's, compared to folks where Alzheimer's had only struck the father.

People with an Alzheimer's-affected mother may therefore be at special risk, said a team from Mass General Brigham, in Boston.

""Maternal inheritance of Alzheimer’s disease may be an important factor in identifying asymptomatic individuals for ongoing and future prevention trials,” said study co-author Dr Reisa Sperling, a neurologist at Mass General.

The findings were published June 17 in the journal JAMA Neurology.

The study was based on data from a clinical trial focused on Alzheimer's prevention. People in the study were asked about whether or not either of their parents had ever been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and when their parent's memory began to fail.

Sperling and colleagues then compared those answers to levels of amyloid in people's brains.

Having had a father who developed Alzheimer's symptoms relatively late in life did not seem to be related to levels of amyloid in people's brains, the research showed.

However, there was a correlation between the accumulation of brain plaques and having had a mother whose Alzheimer's symptoms began at any age, or having a father whose symptoms began relatively early, the team reported.

“If your father had early-onset symptoms, that is associated with elevated [amyloid] levels in the offspring,” said study first author Dr. Mabel Seto, a postdoctoral research fellow in the hospital's department of neurology. “However, it doesn’t matter when your mother started developing symptoms -- if she did at all, it’s associated with elevated amyloid.”

The sex of the study participant did not seem to matter when it came to the relationship between amyloid buildup and parental histories, the researchers noted.

“It’s also important to note a majority of these participants are non-Hispanic white,” Seto added in a Brigham news release. “We might not see the same effect in other races and ethnicities.”

Gene Therapy in Both Ears Restores Hearing to Babies Born Deaf,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

WEDNESDAY, June 5, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Chlidren born deaf have had their hearing restored in both ears as a result of gene therapy, a new study reports.

All five children showed hearing recovery in both ears, with dramatic improvements in speech perception and the ability to locate the position of a sound.

Two of the children also gained an ability to appreciate music, and were observed dancing to music, researchers added.

“The results from these studies are astounding,” said co-senior researcher Zheng-Yi Chen, an associate scientist in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear.

“We continue to see the hearing ability of treated children dramatically progress and the new study shows added benefits of the gene therapy when administrated to both ears, including the ability for sound source localization and improvements in speech recognition in noisy environments,” Chen added in a Mass Eye and Ear news release.

About 26 million people are born deaf, researchers said in background notes. Up to 60% of childhood deafness is caused by genetic factors.

The children in this study all had DFNB9, an inherited hearing condition caused by mutations in the OTOF gene, researchers said.

The condition prevents the production of functioning otoferlin protein, which is needed in the auditory and nerve mechanisms underlying hearing.

There currently are no drugs available to treat inherited deafness conditions like DFNB9, researchers said.

However, this gene therapy already has been proven to work, with a six-patient trial in 2022 showing recovery of hearing in one ear for five kids.

For this study, researchers wanted to see if the gene therapy could restore hearing in both ears at the same time.

“Restoring hearing in both ears of children who are born deaf can maximize the benefits of hearing recovery,” said lead researcher Dr. Yilai Shu, director of the Diagnosis and Treatment Center of Genetic Hearing Loss affiliated with the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai.

The children received functioning copies of the OTOF gene through injections of a virus into their inner ears, starting in June 2023. The hollowed-out virus carried copies of the healthy gene.

The kids were treated at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University and observed for either a 13-week or 26-week period.

Researchers were concerned a double-dose of the virus might cause a stronger immune response, increasing the risk of adverse effects. However, no serious toxicity or serious side effects were observed.

The new study was published June 5 in the journal Nature Medicine.

“Our study strongly supports treating children with DFNB9 in both ears, and our hope is this trial can expand and this approach can also be looked at for deafness caused by other genes or non-genetic causes,” Chen said. “Our ultimate goal is to help people regain hearing no matter how their hearing loss was caused.”

Gene-Targeted Immunotherapy Boosts Survival for Some Colon Cancer Patients,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, June 3, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- There's potential good news for a sizable minority of people battling advanced colon cancer.

Doctors in Britain say that an immunotherapy drug, given before surgery, can help many more patients with a specific genetic profile stay cancer-free long term.

The finding pertains to people with stage 2 or 3 colon tumors with a genetic profile known as MMR deficient/MSI-High.

About 10% to 15% of colon cancers have this profile, said a team led by Dr Kai-Keen Shiu, of the University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute.

Giving patients with advanced MMR deficient/MSI-High colon cancers the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) before their surgery kept up to 10 times as many of them cancer-free, compared to if they had not received the drug, the trial found.

“We need to wait to see whether the patients in our trial remain cancer-free over a longer period of time, but initial indications are extremely positive,"" Shiu said in a university news release. He is a medical oncologist at University College London Health.

The findings were presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The research was funded by Merck Sharp and Dohme, which make Keytruda.

As Shui's team explained, colon cancer caught early has a relatively good prognosis. But five-year survival falls to 65% for folks whose cancer is already at stage 3, and to just 10% for those with stage 4 disease.

Immunotherapies such as Keytruda have worked against many other types of advanced cancers, so the British group tried the therapy in 32 patients with stage 2 or 3 MMR deficient/MSI-High colon cancers.

Patients received nine weeks of Keytruda prior to surgery that aimed at removing the colon tumor.

The result: More than half of patients pre-treated with Keytruda showed no signs of cancer following their surgery, the researchers reported.

Compare that to prior studies, where just 4% of patients were found to be cancer-free after getting chemotherapy alone before their procedures.

""The median cancer-free period was 9.7 months and ranged from 5.3 to 19 months among individual patients,"" according to the UCL news release.

“Our results indicate that pembrolizumab is a safe and highly effective treatment to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk bowel [colon] cancers, increasing the chances of curing the disease at an early stage,"" Shui concluded.

Longer-term follow-up is planned, to see if the benefit lasts over the longer term, the authors said.

“This is a really very exciting new treatment for the 10-15% of patients who have the right genetic makeup. Immunotherapy prior to surgery could well become a ‘game-changer’ for these patients with this type of cancer,"" added Dr. Mark Saunders, a clinical oncologist at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester, U.K.

""Not only is the outcome better, but it saves patients from having more conventional chemotherapy, which often has more side effects,"" Saunders said.

Scientists Spot Gene Behind Form of Intellectual Disability Affecting Thousands Worldwide,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, June 3, 2024 -- Mutations in a single newly identified gene are responsible for developmental disorders affecting tens of thousands of people worldwide, a new study claims.

The gene – RNU4-2 – can cause a collection of developmental symptoms that had not previously been tied to a distinct genetic disorder, researchers report.

The discovery is significant because it represents one of the most common single-gene genetic causes of such disorders, ranking second only to a movement disorder called Rett syndrome, researchers said.

“Nowadays, finding a single gene that harbors genetic variants responsible for tens of thousands of patients with a rare disease is exceptionally unusual,” said lead researcher Daniel Greene, an assistant professor of genetics and genomics sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “Our discovery eluded researchers for years due to various sequencing and analytical challenges.”

More than 99% of genes known to harbor mutations that cause developmental disorders produce proteins through a process called encoding.

These disorders cause developmental delays that affect a person’s social, academic or occupational function, researchers said. They also cause intellectual delays that limit a person’s learning, reasoning and problem-solving skills.

Researchers figured that they might be overlooking some genetic causes of developmental disorder because non-coding genes that don’t produce proteins were being overlooked.

RNU4-2 is a non-coding gene, and researchers discovered it after using a U.K. genetics library to analyze over 41,000 non-coding genes in more than 5,500 people with intellectual disability and about 46,400 healthy people.

The new study appears in the journal Nature Medicine.

""What I found remarkable is how such a common cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder has been missed in the field because we've been focusing on coding genes,” Dr. Heather Mefford, a researcher with the Center for Pediatric Neurological Disease Research at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, said in a news release. Mefford was not involved with the research.

“This study's discovery of mutations in non-coding genes, especially RNU4-2, highlights a significant and previously overlooked cause,” Mefford continued. “It underscores the need to look beyond coding regions, which could reveal many other genetic causes, opening new diagnostic possibilities and research opportunities.""

RNU4-2 is a very short gene, “but this gene plays a crucial role in a basic biological function of cells, called gene splicing, which is present in all animals, plants and fungi,"" said senior researcher Ernest Turro, an associate professor of genetics and genomic sciences at Icahn Mount Sinai.

“Most people with a neurodevelopmental disorder do not receive a molecular diagnosis following genetic testing,” Turro said in a Mount Sinai news release. “Thanks to this study, tens of thousands of families will now be able to obtain a molecular diagnosis for their affected family members, bringing many diagnostic odysseys to a close.”

The gene therapy removed 90% or more of oral herpes infection in lab mice, and it also suppressed how much virus an infected animal shed, according to results published May 13 in the journal Nature Communications.

The experimental therapy involves an injection of gene-editing molecules that seek out herpes virus hiding in the body, researchers said.

“Herpes is very sneaky. It hides out among nerve cells and then reawakens and causes painful skin blisters,” explained researcher Dr. Keith Jerome, a professor in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle.

The gene-editing cocktail includes laboratory-modified delivery viruses that contain an enzyme that works like “molecular scissors,” the researchers said.

Once the delivery virus reaches a cluster of nerves where herpes is hiding, it releases the enzyme. The enzyme then snips away at the herpes virus's genes, to either damage or destroy it.

The enzyme “cuts in two different places in the herpes virus’s DNA,” said lead researcher Martine Albert, a principal staff scientist at Fred Hutch. “These cuts damage the virus so much that it can’t repair itself. Then the body’s own repair systems recognize the damaged DNA as foreign and get rid of it.”

An estimated 3.7 billion people younger than 50 have herpes simplex virus 1, which causes oral herpes, according to the World Health Organization.

Another 491 million people 15 to 49 have herpes simplex 2, which causes genital herpes.

This experimental therapy eliminated 90% of facial infection and 97% of genital infection in lab mice who were infected with herpes simplex 1, researchers say.

It took about a month for the treated mice to reach these reductions, and the reduction of virus appeared to become more complete over time.

“If you talk to people living with herpes, many are worried about whether their infection will transmit to others,” Jerome said in a cancer center news release. “Our new study shows that we can reduce both the amount of virus within the body and how much virus is shed.”

This new therapy represents a streamlined approach to attacking herpes.

In a 2020 study, the research team used three different delivery viruses armed with two different enzymes to attack herpes. This study used just one delivery virus and one enzyme capable of cutting the virus DNA in two places.

“Our streamlined gene-editing approach is effective at eliminating the herpes virus and has less side effects to the liver and nerves,” Jerome said. “This suggests that the therapy will be safer for people and easier to make, since it has fewer ingredients.”

Researchers are preparing to translate the findings into treatments for humans that can be tested in clinical trials.

“We’re collaborating with numerous partners as we approach clinical trials so we align with federal regulators to ensure safety and effectiveness of the gene therapy,” Jerome said.

The team also is adapting the gene-editing technology to target herpes simplex 2 viruses.

Baby Girl Born Deaf Gains Hearing After Gene Therapy,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

FRIDAY, May 10, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Opal Sandy was born into a world she could not hear.

The British baby girl, now 18 months old, had a rare genetic condition called auditory neuropathy that interrupted nerve impulses that travel from the inner ear to the brain. She'd been fitted with a cochlear implant, but it could only help so much.

Then came a breakthrough gene therapy trial conducted by a team at Cambridge University Hospitals in England that's brought a world of sound to little Opal.

""When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was mind-blowing — we were so happy when the clinical team confirmed at 24 weeks that her hearing was also picking up softer sounds and speech,"" her mother Jo Sandy said in a hospital news release. ""The phrase ‘near normal’ hearing was used and everyone was so excited such amazing results had been achieved.""

Opal is the first child in the U.K. and the youngest in the world to receive the new therapy.

""These results are spectacular and better than I expected,"" said Dr. Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at the hospital and chief investigator of the new trial. ""Gene therapy has been the future in otology and audiology for many years and I’m so excited that it is now finally here. This is hopefully the start of a new era for gene therapies for the inner ear and many types of hearing loss.""

He and his colleagues presented their findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Baltimore.

As the researchers explained, auditory neuropathy can arise from a single variation in a gene called OTOF, responsible for producing a protein called otoferlin. The tiny hairs of the inner ear need otoferlin to transmit signals to nerves responsible for hearing.

The gene deficiency behind auditory neuropathy often goes undetected in newborn screenings, so children with the condition are often not diagnosed until age 2 or 3, when delays in speech have set in.

“We have a short time frame to intervene because of the rapid pace of brain development at this age,"" Bance said in the news release. ""Delays in the diagnosis can also cause confusion for families as the many reasons for delayed speech and late intervention can impact a children’s development.”

Opal's parents knew their daughter was at risk for auditory neuropathy because her older sister already had the condition. Gene tests conducted when Opal was just three weeks old confirmed that she too carried the gene variant.

The gene therapy Opal received involved the transmission into her right ear of a working copy of the OTOF gene, delivered during surgery into the ear's cochlea via a harmless virus called AAV1. The baby girl was also fitted out with a cochlear implant in her left ear.

Six months later, the results were already remarkable, her parents and doctors said. Opal could respond to sound even when her left ear cochlear implant was switched off. She could even detect low sounds such as whispers in her treated right ear.

At 18 months, Opal easily responds to her parents' voices and uses words like ""Dada"" and ""bye bye.""

""It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech sounds,"" said her father, James Sandy. ""It’s already making a difference to our day-to-day lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can’t wear her cochlear implant. We feel so proud to have contributed to such pivotal findings, which will hopefully help other children like Opal and their families in the future.""

The global trial is ongoing, and experts believe gene therapy could revolutionize the treatment of hearing loss.

""Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated,"" Martin McLean, senior policy advisor at the National Deaf Children’s Society in Britain, said in the hospital news release. ""This trial will teach us more about the effectiveness of gene therapy in those cases where deafness has a specific genetic cause.""

Gene Discovery Points to a New Form of Alzheimer's,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, May 7, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- People who carry two copies of the gene mutation most strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease are almost certain to develop brain changes related to the degenerative disorder, a new study says.

A single mutated APOE4 gene has been found to pose the strongest genetics-driven risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s, researchers said.

Virtually everyone with two copies of the APOE4 gene mutation wound up with higher levels of Alzheimer’s-related brain by age 55, compared to people with another version of APOE, researchers reported May 6 in the journal Nature Medicine.

By age 65, more than 95% of people with two APOE4 genes showed abnormal levels of amyloid protein in their cerebrospinal fluid and 75% had positive amyloid scans, researchers said. Amyloid beta plaques are one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer’s.

These findings suggest that having two copies of the APOE4 gene could represent a new genetic form of Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Juan Fortea, director of the Memory Unit at the Sant Pau Research Institute’s Neurology Service in Barcelona, Spain.

“This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology,” Fortea said in a news release.

“This is important because they represent between 2 and 3% of the population,"" he added.

For the study, Fortea and colleagues analyzed data from nearly 3,300 brain donors, including samples from 273 people with two copies of the APOE4 gene.

The team also evaluated clinical data from more than 10,000 people with evidence of Alzheimer’s disease, including 519 people with two copies of APOE4.

""The data clearly show that having two copies of the APOE4 gene not only increases the risk, but also anticipates the onset of Alzheimer's, reinforcing the need for specific preventive strategies,” researcher Dr. Alberto Lleó, director of the Sant Pau Research Institute’s Neurology Service, said in a news release.

Because people who test positive for two copies of APOE4 are almost certain to develop Alzheimer’s, they could be the focus of clinical trials aimed at testing targeted prevention and treatment methods, the researchers said.

Gene Therapy Improves Vision in People With Inherited Blindness,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, May 6, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- An injectable gene therapy caused measurable improvements in vision among a small group of people with inherited blindness, an early-stage clinical trial says.

Researchers recruited 14 people with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), a rare genetic condition that causes babies to lose some or all of their sight from birth.

Eleven of the 14 had measurable improvements in the vision of one eye that received a single injection of a gene-editing medication, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision,” researcher Dr. Tomas Aleman, a pediatric ophthalmologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a news release.

“While more research is needed to determine who may benefit most, we consider the early results promising,” added lead researcher Dr. Eric Pierce, director of Mass Eye and Ear Ocular Genomics Institute and Berman-Gund Laboratory for the Study of Retinal Degenerations in Boston.

“To hear from several participants how thrilled they were that they could finally see the food on their plates – that is a big deal,” Pierce said. “These were individuals who could not read any lines on an eye chart and who had no treatment options, which is the unfortunate reality for most people with inherited retinal disorders.”

LCA affects 2 to 3 out of 100,000 babies born each year, researchers said.

Many babies born with LCA are born blind, and those who aren’t typically begin losing their sight by around 6 months of age.

LCA is caused by mutations in the centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) gene, researchers said.

These mutations cause malfunctions in the rods and cones of the retina, which detect incoming visual signals and process them into electrical signals received by the brain, researchers said.

CEP290 gene mutations are the leading cause of inherited blindness that take place during a person’s first decade of life, researchers said.

To come up with a genetic solution, researchers turned to CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing toolkit that essentially acts as a pair of gene-level scissors. The tool can cut away a portion of a mutated gene, potentially rendering it functional following the edit.

The resulting clinical trial proved the first time any patient ever received a CRISPR-based gene medicine directly inside their bodies, researchers said.

Results showed that:

11 participants, or about 79%, had improvement in at least one of four measured vision outcomes.

6 participants, or about 43%, showed improvement in two or more outcomes.

6 participants, or about 43%, reported improved vision-related quality of life.

4 participants, or about 29%, had clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity, or how well they could identify objects or letters on a chart.

“We’ve demonstrated that we can safely deliver a CRISPR-based gene editing therapeutic to the retina and have clinically meaningful outcomes,” Dr. Baisong Mei, chief medical officer for Editas Medicine, the Cambridge, Mass., biotech company that created the injection, said in a news release.

The first injection of CRISPR treatment for an LCA patient occurred in early 2020 at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.

“There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment,” Dr. Mark Pennesi, the OHSU professor of ophthalmology who led the treatment there, said in a news release.

“One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights,” Pennesi said. “While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.”

Other LCA patients received the gene treatment at Mass Eye and Ear; the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami; the W.K. Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.; and the Scheie Eye Institute at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The treatments involved 12 adults and two children, researchers said. Participants were monitored every three months for one year, and then less often for two more years.

Editas funded the clinical trial, which was paused in November 2022 to seek other commercial partners to collaborate in development of the experimental therapy.

Researchers are now exploring working with other commercial partners in collaboration with Editas to conduct additional, larger-scale trials.

Living Healthy Counters Effects of 'Life-Shortening' Genes,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, April 30, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors argue that genetics aren’t destiny when it comes to a person’s health, and a study appears to support that notion.

A healthy lifestyle can offset the effects of life-shortening genes by more than 60%, researchers found.

People at high genetic risk of a curtailed lifespan could extend their life expectancy by nearly 5.5 years if they’ve adopted a healthy lifestyle by age 40, results show.

On the other hand, an unhealthy lifestyle is associated with a 78% increased risk of an early death, regardless of a person’s genetic predisposition.

The study highlights “the pivotal role of a healthy lifestyle in mitigating the impact of genetic factors on lifespan reduction,” concluded the research team led by Dr. Xue Li with the Center of Clinical Big Data and Analytics of The Second Affiliated Hospital at Zhejiang University School of Medicine in Hangzhou, China.

“Public health policies for improving healthy lifestyles would serve as potent complements to conventional healthcare and mitigate the influence of genetic factors on human lifespan,” the researchers said.

For the study, researchers analyzed data drawn from nearly 354,000 people participating in the UK Biobank genetics and health study. More than 24,000 died over an average follow-up of nearly 13 years.

Each person was scored based on their genetic health risks, and they also received a score regarding the healthiness of their lifestyle.

A healthy lifestyle included no smoking, moderate drinking, regular physical activity, a healthy body shape, adequate sleep and a healthy diet, researchers said.

About 23% had a completely healthy lifestyle based on those measures, 56% had a moderately healthy lifestyle, while 22% had an unhealthy lifestyle.

Those genetically predisposed to a short lifespan were 21% more likely than those genetically predisposed to a long life, regardless of lifestyle.

But those with an unhealthy lifestyle were 78% more likely to die early than those with a healthy lifestyle, regardless of their genetics.

Overall, those who combined bad genetics and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die as those with good genes who were living healthy, results show.

Four factors in particular contributed to healthy living that made a difference in longevity, researchers said -- not smoking, regular exercise, good sleep and a healthy diet.

The new study was published April 29 in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine.

Scientists Discover Cause of Rare Movement Disorder,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

MONDAY, April 29, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have conclusively identified the genetic cause of a rare, progressive movement disorder.

A rare extra-long version of a gene appears to cause nerve cells to become poisoned by toxic proteins in people with spinocerebellar ataxia 4 (SCA4), researchers report.

SCA4 causes muscle weakness and difficulty coordinating body movement, most notably resulting in a jerky and unsteady walking style and difficulty speaking, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The disease also causes a progressive loss of feeling in the hands and feet and a loss of reflexes, the NIH says.

There’s no known cure for SCA4, and up to now there was no known cause, researchers said.

SCA4’s pattern of inheritance had long made it clear the disease was genetic, but researchers have struggled for 25 years to figure out the exact genetics behind the disorder.

Now, using a recently developed advanced sequencing technology to analyze the genetics of several Utah families, researchers found a section in a gene called ZFHX3 that’s much longer than it should be, containing an extra-long string of repetitive DNA.

Human cells that have the extra-long version of ZFHX3 appear to be sick. They aren’t able to recycle proteins as well as they should, and some contain clumps of stuck-together protein.

“This mutation is a toxic expanded repeat and we think that it actually jams up how a cell deals with unfolded or misfolded proteins,” said senior researcher Dr. Stefan Pulst, chair of neurology at the University of Utah School of Medicine.

Healthy cells need to constantly break down proteins that are no longer functioning. Researchers demonstrated that the SCA4-causing mutation could essentially poison nerve cells by gumming up the works of the cells’ protein-recycling machinery.

The new study was published April 29 in the journal Nature Genetics.

Figuring out the cause of SCA4 is the first step in developing effective treatments, Pulst said.

“The only step to really improve the life of patients with inherited disease is to find out what the primary cause is,” Pulst said in a university news release. “We now can attack the effects of this mutation potentially at multiple levels.""

For example, a similar process interfering with protein recycling occurs in another movement disorder called SCA2, researchers noted.

A potential therapy for SCA2 is currently being tested in a clinical trial, and there’s a possibility that it might work for SCA4 as well, given the results of this study.

People in families affected by SCA4 can also find out if they have this specific genetic change, which can help them prepare for its onset, said lead researcher Pattie Figueroa, a project manager in neurology at the University of Utah School of Medicine.

“They can come and get tested and they can have an answer, for better or for worse,” Figueroa said.

“I’ve been working on SCA4 directly since 2010 when the first family approached me, and once you go to their homes and get to know them, they’re no longer the number on the DNA vial,” Figueroa added. “These are people you see every day… You can’t walk away. This is not just science. This is somebody’s life.”

Patient Gets First-Ever Pig Kidney Transplant Plus Heart Pump,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

WEDNESDAY, April 24, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- New Jersey native Lisa Pisano was staring down the end of her days.

The 54-year-old had heart failure and end-stage kidney disease, but several chronic medical conditions excluded her as a candidate for heart and kidney transplants.

“All I want is the opportunity to have a better life,” Pisano said in a news release. “After I was ruled out for a human transplant, I learned I didn’t have a lot of time left.”

But Pisano has gotten a new lease on life, thanks to a combined transplant of a mechanical heart pump and a gene-edited pig kidney.

It’s the first time the two vastly different medical technologies have been performed on one patient, said surgeons at NYU Langone Health in New York City.

There are no documented instances of anyone with a mechanical heart pump receiving an organ transplant of any kind, they added.

What’s more, this is only the second known transplant of a gene-edited pig kidney into a living person, they said.

The first occurred in March, with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital placing a genetically tweaked pig kidney into Rick Slayman, 62, of Weymouth, Mass.

“It is incredible to consider the scientific achievements that have led to our ability to save Lisa’s life, and what we are endeavoring to do as a society for everyone in need of a life-saving organ,” said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.

Nearly 104,000 people are on the waiting list for a transplant, including more than 89,000 waiting for a kidney, the doctors said in background notes.

About 808,000 people in the United States have end-stage kidney disease, but only about 27,000 received a transplant last year, they added.

Surgeons first implanted the heart pump into Pisano, and days later followed up by implanting the gene-edited pig kidney and the pig’s thymus gland to help ward off rejection.

Without the heart pump, Pisano’s life expectancy would have been measured in days or weeks, researchers said.

But Pisano was stuck in a Catch-22, as patients with chronic kidney disease typically aren’t allowed to get a heart pump.

“Without the possibility of a kidney transplant, she would not have been eligible as a candidate for [a heart pump], due to the high mortality in patients on dialysis with heart pumps,” said Dr. Nader Moazami, chief of heart and lung transplantation at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

“This unique approach is the first time in the world that [heart pump] surgery has been done on a dialysis patient with a subsequent plan to transplant a kidney,” Moazami added in an NYU Langone news release.

The pump was implanted on April 4, and the pig kidney transplant occurred on April 12.

Pisano had high levels of harmful antibodies that would have attacked any transplanted human kidney, doctors noted. It likely would have taken years to find an appropriate human match.

But Montgomery found that an experimental gene-edited pig kidney developed by United Therapeutics Corp. was not only available, but also was a good match for Pisano.

The kidney was engineered to block a gene responsible for producing a sugar known as alpha-gal. Previous studies have shown that removing alpha-gal can prevent an antibody reaction that can trigger rejection of the pig kidney.

Pisano also received the donor pig’s thymus gland, which is responsible for educating the immune system and will further lower the risk of rejection.

Other experimental gene-edited pig organs have included many different genetic alterations intended to ward off rejection, but Montgomery thinks simple could be better.

“By using pigs with a single genetic modification, we can better understand the role one key stable change in the genome can have in making xenotransplantation a viable alternative,” Montgomery said.

“Since these pigs can be bred and do not require cloning like more-complex gene edits, this is a sustainable, scalable solution to the organ shortage,” Montgomery added. “If we want to start saving more lives quickly, using fewer modifications and medications will be the answer.”

Rare Genes Can Raise Odds for Obesity 6-Fold,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, April 4, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Two newly discovered genetic variations can have a powerful effect on a person’s risk for obesity, a new report says.

Variants in the gene BSN, also known as Bassoon, can increase risk of obesity as much as sixfold, researchers report April 4 in the journal Nature Genetics.

These variants affect about 1 in every 6,500 adults, researchers said.

Variants of the APBA1 gene also are associated with increased obesity risk, results show.

“We have identified two genes with variants that have the most profound impact on obesity risk at a population level we’ve ever seen,” said researcher Giles Yeo, a professor with the Medical Research Council’s Metabolic Diseases Unit at Cambridge University.

Previous genetic variants associated with obesity have been linked to the brain pathways normally associated with appetite regulation, known as the leptin-melanocortin pathway, researchers said.

Interestingly, neither the BSN nor the APBA1 gene are known to be involved in that brain pathway, researchers said.

Instead, prior studies have found that these genes play a role in the transmission of signals between brain cells -- suggesting that age-related brain declines might affect appetite control.

Further, neither gene is associated with childhood obesity risk, researchers said.

For the study, researchers used data from the UK Biobank genetic research project to perform genetic sequencing of body mass index in more than a half-million people.

They found that the BSN gene variants also had other health effects, such as increasing risk of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

“The genetic variants we identify in BSN confer some of the largest effects on obesity, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease observed to date and highlight a new biological mechanism regulating appetite control,” researcher John Perry, a professor at Cambridge, said in a university news release.

Mutation Helps Even Carriers of 'Alzheimer's Gene' Avoid Alzheimer's,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

FRIDAY, March 29, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- A genetic mutation that boosts cell function could protect people against Alzheimer’s disease, even if they carry another gene mutation known to boost dementia risk.

The newly discovered mutation appears to protect people who carry the APOE4 gene, which increases risk of Alzheimer’s, researchers said.

The protective mutation causes cells to produce a more powerful version of humanin, a tiny protein that plays an important role in cellular function.

Humanin levels are higher in people who have reached the age of 100 despite carrying the APOE4 gene, which predisposes people to early death as well as Alzheimer’s, researchers discovered.

Humanin produced by this variant also effectively cleared amyloid beta from the brains of lab mice carrying APOE4, researchers report.

“This new study sheds light on resilience genes that help people live longer and partially explains why some people at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease are spared,” said senior study author Dr. Pinchas Cohen, dean of the University of Southern California (USC) Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.

The gene variant that causes higher levels of humanin is called P3S-humanin, researchers said.

This variant is thought to be extremely rare, and is found primarily in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, researchers said.

Mitochondria, the energy powerhouse of cells, produce humanin to protect against cellular aging and stress, according to a 2023 review in the journal Biology.

Humanin has been shown to protect brain health, and can reduce inflammation and stress, the review says. It also can improve blood sugar metabolism and insulin resistance, two contributing factors to type 2 diabetes.

For the new study, researchers examined more than 500 healthy centenarians, near-centenarians and their children.

They found that about 12% of centenarians of Ashkenazi descent carried the P3S variant, compared to less than 0.2% of others.

Brain function tests among centenarians with the APOE4 gene found that those who also carried the PS3-humanin gene outperformed those who didn’t, suggesting that the humanin variant blunted some of their Alzheimer’s risk.

Between 40% and 60% of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s carry the APOE4 gene, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.

Researchers then turned to mice genetically engineered to carry a humanized APOE4 gene. They found that treatment with PS3 gene-produced humanin resulted in a marked reduction of amyloid beta in the brains of the mice.

Treatment with standard humanin protein also resulted in some decrease of amyloid beta, but the effect was more powerful with the genetic variant, researchers said.

Amyloid beta plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.

Analysis showed that PS3-derived humanin allows it to bind more effectively with the APOE4 gene, researchers said.

“This humanin P3S, when made by mitochondria, actually binds the protein product of APOE4 very tightly. This seems to help clear away harmful amyloid-beta, which builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s,” said lead researcher Brendan Miller, a postdoctoral scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

“Our experiments showed that this protein variant could be a reason why some people with the risk-gene avoid Alzheimer’s and maintain good brain health into old age,” Miller added in a USC news release.

Future Alzheimer’s drugs might target APOE4 by using insights gained from PS3-derived humanin, Cohen said, and humanin also might be used to help people resist other age-related diseases.

The new study was published March 22 in the journal Aging Cell.

Stressed? Some Genes Could Raise Your Heart Attack Risk,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, March 28, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Folks with genetically-driven stress are more likely to suffer heart attacks after nerve-wracking events or times of unrest, a new study shows.

People with above-average genetic scores linked to neuroticism and stress were 34% more likely to experience a heart attack following stressful periods, researchers found.

Further, these jittery individuals were more than three times as likely to have a heart attack during stressful times if they also had anxiety or depression.

“We found people who are genetically predisposed to stress tend to have a strikingly higher probability of developing a heart attack after these stressful events,” said lead researcher Dr. Shady Abohashem, an instructor of cardiovascular imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

For the study, researchers analyzed data on nearly 18,500 participants in the Mass General Brigham Biobank, a program that captures genetic data for use in medical research.

Researchers compared genetic stress scores among people who had a heart attack after stressful times against those who had a heart attack during calmer times and those who’d never had a cardiac event.

For the study, periods considered to be highly stressful included:

The 10 days after Christmas.

The five days after presidential elections.

The five days after major sporting events like Super Bowls or NBA playoffs involving Boston-area teams.

People with above-average genetic stress scores had a 34% higher risk of heart attack during those periods than at other times of the year, even after researchers accounted for other traditional heart risk factors.

High genetic stress scores also make people more likely to experience anxiety and depression, researchers said. Having anxiety or depression accounts for nearly one-quarter of the association between genetically-driven stress and stress-triggered heart attacks.

People with the combination of an above-average genetic risk for stress and either anxiety or depression were 3.2 times more likely to have a heart attack after a stressful period, researchers found.

The findings will be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s annual meeting in Atlanta in early April. Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

It’s not feasible to screen everyone for a genetic predisposition to stress, but the findings could still help identify people at higher risk for a heart attack by screening for anxiety or depression, Abohashem said.

“We now understand that there are certain factors driving this increase in heart attacks in those who are at increased risk,” Abohashem said in an meeting news release. “We could potentially target those people with screenings and dual-benefit interventions, such as exercise, yoga, mindfulness or other approaches that are associated with reductions in anxiety and depression and also with lowering cardiovascular risk.”

Surgeons Implant Pig Kidney Into First Living Human Patient,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, March 21, 2024 (HealthDay news) -- For the first time ever, doctors have transplanted a genetically edited pig kidney into a human suffering from advanced kidney failure.

Such pig kidneys, altered to lower the risk of rejection and disease, have been successfully placed into monkeys and brain-dead human donor bodies.

But Rick Slayman, 62, is the first living patient to receive a gene-edited pig kidney, in an operation last weekend that took four hours, according to his doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston.

The Weymouth, Mass., resident is recovering well and is expected to be discharged soon, his doctors said.

Slayman said he agreed to the transplant after MGH doctors suggested it, “carefully explaining the pros and cons of this procedure.”

“I saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,” Slayman said in a hospital news release.

Dr. Winfred Williams, associate chief of the nephrology division at MGH and the patient’s primary kidney doctor, hailed Slayman’s “courageousness in becoming a trailblazer in the field of transplantation.”

The pig kidney came from eGenesis, a Cambridge, Mass., company that has been experimenting with genetic alterations to make pig organs transplantable to humans.

Last year, eGenesis reported in the journal Nature that a monkey had been living with one of its transplanted pig kidneys for two years.

The kidney Slayman received had 69 genetic edits that removed harmful pig genes and added helpful human genes, researchers said. Scientists also inactivated retroviruses in the pig donor to eliminate any risk of infection in humans.

Slayman is Black, and Black patients tend to suffer high rates of end-stage kidney disease, the New York Times reported.

These genetically altered pig kidneys represent a “potential breakthrough in solving one of the more intractable problems in our field, that being unequal access for ethnic minority patients to the opportunity for kidney transplants due to the extreme donor organ shortage and other system-based barriers,” Williams said.

Slayman has been living with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure for many years, doctors said. He received a kidney transplant from a human donor in December 2018, but the organ began to fail after five years and he resumed dialysis in May 2023.

He’s since been in and out of the hospital regularly, due to complications stemming from his dialysis, doctors said.

More than 100,000 people in the United States are awaiting an organ for transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. About 17 people die each day for want of a donor organ.

Kidneys are the most common organs needed for transplant, doctors said. End-stage kidney disease rates are expected to increase from 29% to 68% in the United States by 2030.

“At MGH alone, there are over 1,400 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. Some of these patients will unfortunately die or get too sick to be transplanted due to the long waiting time on dialysis. I am firmly convinced that xenotransplantation represents a promising solution to the organ shortage crisis,” said Dr. Leonardo Riella, MGH medical director for kidney transplantation.

Last weekend’s procedure was performed under a compassionate use waiver granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February, doctors said.

To help Slayman avoid rejection, he also received an infusion of two new immunosuppressant drugs -- tegoprubart, provided by Eledon Pharmaceuticals Inc., and ravulizumab, provided by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Researchers Find Gene That May Shield Men From Severe COVID-19,"By Carole Tanzer Miller HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, March 14, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- It only appears to work until age 74, but a new study has identified a gene variant that protects men from from severe illness and death when COVID lands them in the hospital.

The protective gene appears to help tamp down inflammation, researchers say. It is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (1L1RN) variant.

While inflammation is a normal response to infection, if left unchecked, it can damage tissues as part of many diseases, including severe cases of COVID.

""Our study results show that among hospitalized patients, while women are still overall less likely than men to die from COVID-19, those men age 74 and younger who possess the IL1RN gene variant rs419598 are much less likely to suffer the severe inflammation tied to SARS-CoV-2 infection and less likely to die from the disease,"" said study co-author Mukundan Attur, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health in New York City.

The study found that 124 men (aged 19-74) who had the gene variant were 80% less likely to die from COVID. They were also less likely to become severely ill after being hospitalized with the virus.

Researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine called their findings noteworthy because more men than women die from COVID. The gene variant appears to protect only men up to about age 74, but not beyond that as the chronic illnesses of aging take hold, they said.

For the study, researchers obtained blood samples from nearly 2,600 men and women hospitalized for COVID at NYU Langone's Tisch Hospital in Manhattan between March 2020 and March 2021.

More than half were 60 or older and obese, putting them at higher risk of death from COVID. In all, 240 men and 157 women in the study died from their disease.

Researchers found that average blood levels of an inflammation-fighting protein coded by 1L1RN were 14 times higher in hospitalized men than in healthy male controls. While they were 10 times higher in 178 hospitalized women than in healthy women, researchers said they did not result in a statistically significant reduction in death risk for women.

Senior study author Dr. Steven Abrahamson, a rheumatologist who serves as chairman of the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone, said the finding points to a pathway to prevent the severe inflammation often seen in COVID.

More study is needed to learn whether IL-1-inhibiting therapies such as anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept are effective against COVID, he said.

He plans to investigate whether the IL-1 pathway contributes to Long COVID, the constellation of symptoms that persist months after initial infection.

Abrahamson said the new study adds to evidence about the underlying biology that contributes to gender differences in death rates from COVID.

The findings were published March 13 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Why Some Folks Get COVID and Others Never Do,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

FRIDAY, Feb. 2, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Everyone knows someone who gets COVID-19 repeatedly, and they probably also have that annoying friend who's never had the illness. What gives?

According to new research, over the long-term it's probably genetics that drives an individual's level of susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2.

“Our results suggest that initially, differences in shared home environment influenced who was infected with COVID-19 more than genetic differences,” explained study lead author Katie LaRow Brown, a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University in New York City.

“Over time, however, the importance of these differences in shared home environment decreased -- and the importance of genetics increased -- eventually eclipsing shared home environment,"" she said. Brown spoke in a news release from Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, which was also involved in the research.

According to background info, since the pandemic began over 340 million Americans have been infected by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus.

However, the role that environment and genetics may play in who gets infected is still poorly understood.

In the new study, Brown and colleagues looked at data from the electronic health records of patients at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Almost 13,000 of the patients received conclusive results on COVID-19 PCR tests taken between late February 2021 and late October 2022.

Typically, patients came from families where an average 2.5 members had contracted COVID-19.

Parsing out genetics versus environmental factors, the researchers found that the relationship changed over time.

Earlier in the pandemic, a person's genetics accounted for about 33% of the variation in their susceptibility to COVID-19, but by the second half of the study, genetics' role in susceptibility rose to 70%.

Looking at the severity of COVID illness (based on days spent in the hospital), genetics again trumped home environments. The study found that genetics explained 41% of variations in case severity, while shared environment explained 33%.

“We were especially surprised by the percentages of susceptibility,” said senior study author Nicholas Tatonetti.

The findings were published recently in the journal Nature Communications.

“Since this is an infectious disease, we assumed that home environment differences would explain most variation for the entirety of the study,"" said Tatonetti, vice chair of operations in the department of computational biomedicine and an associate director of computational oncology at Cedars-Sinai Cancer.

It's not yet clear which DNA is driving the gap between who gets COVID-19 and who doesn't. Finding out ""is very important in terms of directing resources and defining future research goals,"" Tatonetti said.

Many Labradors Become Obese and Research Shows Why,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, March 7, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Nearly a quarter of Labrador retrievers are more likely to be obese due to a genetic “double-whammy,” a new study finds.

This gene mutation causes Labradors to both feel hungry all the time and also burn fewer calories, British researchers report.

The mutation involves a gene called POMC, which plays a critical role in hunger and energy use among Labs.

About 25% of Labradors and 66% of flat-coated retriever dogs have this POMC mutation, which causes increased interest in food, researchers said.

Specifically, it makes them hungrier in between meals, even though they don’t need to eat more to feel full at mealtime.

“We found that a mutation in the POMC gene seems to make dogs hungrier. Affected dogs tend to overeat because they get hungry between meals more quickly than dogs without the mutation,” said study author Eleanor Raffan, a researcher in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience.

Dogs with the POMC mutation also tend to burn about 25% less energy at rest than dogs without it, the researchers added. That means they should consume fewer calories to maintain a healthy body weight.

“Dogs with this genetic mutation face a double whammy: They not only want to eat more, but also need fewer calories because they’re not burning them off as fast,” Raffan said in a university news release.

The mutation in the POMC gene causes dogs to not produce two chemical messengers in their brain, beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (β-MSH) and beta-endorphin, that are important in determining hunger and moderating energy use, researchers said.

The new study involved 87 adult Labradors, all at a healthy weight or slightly overweight.

First, the dogs were given a can of dog food every 20 minutes until they chose not to eat any more.

All the Labs ate huge amounts of food, but the dogs with the POMC mutation didn’t eat more than those without it -- an indication that they all feel full with a similar amount of food.

Next, researchers put the Labs through the “sausage in a box” test.

On a different day, the dogs were fed a standard amount of breakfast. Exactly three hours later, they were offered a sausage in a box made of clear plastic and a perforated lid, so the Labs could see and smell the sausage but couldn’t eat it.

Labradors with the POMC mutation tried significantly harder to get the sausage out of the box, researchers found. That indicates those dogs were much more hungry between meals.

Lastly, the Labradors slept in a special chamber that captured the gases they breathe out, which can be used to measure body metabolism. Dogs with the POMC mutation burned around 25% fewer calories while resting, compared to other dogs.

“People are often rude about the owners of fat dogs, blaming them for not properly managing their dogs’ diet and exercise,” Raffan said. “But we’ve shown that Labradors with this genetic mutation are looking for food all the time, trying to increase their energy intake. It’s very difficult to keep these dogs slim, but it can be done.”

One way it can be done? Some research has suggested that probiotics can help overweight dogs shed pounds.

These findings could be helpful for humans as well, given that the brain pathways affected by the POMC mutation are similar in dogs and humans, researchers said.

Humans with POMC mutations tend to experience extreme hunger and become obese at an earlier age, researchers said in background notes.

Drugs currently in development for humans target these pathways to treat obesity, low sexual desire and certain skin conditions, researchers said.

The new study was published March 6 in the journal Science Advances.

Remains Show Prehistoric Peoples Cared for Those With Down Syndrome,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 21, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Rare gene-driven defects such as Down syndrome have occurred among human beings for many thousands of years, a new analysis of ancient DNA has revealed.

Not only did the birth defects exist, but these infants were often buried with care by their community. That suggests they were included as part of the community despite their differences, researchers said.

Six cases of Down syndrome and one case of Edward syndrome (a more severe condition) have been found in the surviving DNA of human populations living in Spain, Bulgaria, Finland and Greece as long as 4,500 years ago, researchers said.

These results came from DNA analysis of about 10,000 ancient humans looking for autosomal trisomies, a birth defect in which people carry an extra copy of one of the first 22 chromosomes.

All of the cases were detected in infant burials, but from different cultures and time periods, researchers said.

“Using a new statistical model, we screened the DNA extracted from human remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages all the way up to the mid-1800s,” said lead researcher Adam Rohrlach, a statistician from the University of Adelaide’s School of Mathematical Sciences in Australia.

Down syndrome occurs when a person is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is associated with developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and a characteristic set of facial features, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“While we expected that people with Down syndrome certainly existed in the past, this is the first time we’ve been able to reliably detect cases in ancient remains, as they can’t be confidently diagnosed by looking at the skeletal remains alone,” Rohrlach said in a university news release.

The statistical model used for the new analysis identifies when a person has about 50% too much DNA coming from one specific chromosome, researchers said.

“We then compared the remains of the individuals with Down syndrome for common skeletal abnormalities such as irregular bone growth, or porosity of the skull bones, which may help to identify future cases of Down syndrome when ancient DNA can’t be recovered,” said researcher Patxuka de-Miguel-Ibáñez of the University of Alicante in Spain.

The study also uncovered a case of Edwards syndrome, an even rarer condition caused by three copies of chromosome 18.

This genetic defect causes far more severe symptoms than Down syndrome, researchers said. The remains showed signs of severe abnormalities in bone growth, and the child died around 40 weeks gestation.

All of these infants were buried with care, showing that ancient societies understood they were part of their community despite their birth defects, researchers said.

This was particularly true of the Early Iron Age in Spain, where researchers found the single case of Edwards syndrome and an increased number of cases of Down syndrome.

The new study was published Feb. 20 in the journal Nature Communications.

“The remains could not confirm that these babies survived to birth, but they were among the infants buried within homes at the settlement, or within other important buildings,” said researcher Roberto Risch, an archaeologist from The Autonomous University of Barcelona.

“We don’t know why this happened, as most people were cremated during this time, but it appears as if they were purposefully choosing these infants for special burials,” Risch continued.

Preventive Mastectomies May Save Lives of Women With Breast Cancer Genes,"By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, Feb. 20, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry certain mutations in their BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes know they are at heightened odds for breast cancer.

Now, Canadian research suggests that for some patients a ""risk-reducing"" preventive mastectomy may cut the odds of dying from breast cancer later.

“The decision to have a risk-reducing mastectomy is often difficult for a woman to make, and the more evidence we are able to provide them with when they are making that decision, the more informed their care plan will be,” said study lead author Kelly Metcalfe, of the University of Toronto.

Her team published its findings recently in the British Journal of Cancer.

It's well-known that carrying certain variants of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene raises a woman's lifetime odds for breast cancer by 80%, the researchers said.

Having breasts removed can prevent the disease by 90% in these women, studies have shown. In Canada, 30% of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene carriers at higher odds for breast cancer opt for the surgery, Metcalfe's group noted.

But will this drastic surgery really lower a woman's odds for fatal breast cancer?

In the study, the research team looked at data on over 1,600 women from nine countries. All carried BRCA genes tied to heightened breast cancer risk, and half of the women underwent risk-reducing mastectomies.

At six years of follow up, there were 20 cases of breast cancer and two deaths in women who had opted for risk-reducing mastectomy, the study found.

That's far less than the 100 breast cancer cases and seven deaths among women with the BRCA genes who had not opted for the procedure.

Overall, risk-reducing mastectomy cut risks of getting breast cancer by 80%, the study found. The odds of dying from breast cancer 15 years after the mastectomy was just 1%.

Metcalfe believes more studies are needed that can track women's outcomes even longer.

“Right now, we have good screening in place for breast cancer, including breast MRI, so surgery is only offered as an option, not a recommendation,” Metcalfe said in a university news release. “But with more studies being conducted to assess women’s trajectory and risk factors following [risk-reducing mastectomy], we will know whether these guidelines need to be changed in the future.”

Gene-Based Tests Could Predict Your Odds for Common Illnesses,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

TUESDAY, Feb. 20, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Accurate genetic tests for 10 common diseases are nearly ready for everyday use in doctor’s offices, a new study says.

Gene scans for 10 common illnesses have been honed to the point that they now are being road-tested in clinical research, according to a team at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

The tests evaluate a person’s specific genetic risk for conditions like atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, kidney disease, heart disease, high cholesterol, prostate cancer, asthma, type 1 and type 2 diabetes and obesity.

“With this work, we’ve taken the first steps toward showing the potential strength and power of these scores across a diverse population,” said researcher Niall Lennon, chief scientific officer of Broad Clinical Labs.

“We hope in the future this kind of information can be used in preventive medicine to help people take actions that lower their risk of disease,” Lennon added in a Broad Institute news release.

Researchers honed the genetic risk scores using a diverse group of 2,500 people. About one in five participants were found to be at high risk for at least one of the 10 targeted diseases, results show.

The tests now are being used to evaluate the risk of 25,000 participants at 10 academic medical centers across the United States, researchers said. The centers are all part of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network, a federally funded effort to study how genetic data can improve health care.

For each of the 10 diseases, researchers identified and verified exact spots in the genome to be analyzed for the risk score.

To make the risk scores more accurate, researchers also widened their evidence review to include people of different genetic ancestries. Up to now, most such tests have been based largely on genetic data from people of European ancestry.

This team used data from the federally funded All of Us Research Program, which is collecting health information from 1 million people from diverse backgrounds in the United States.

The All of Us dataset includes three times more people of non-European ancestry than other major genetic collections of data used to develop genetic risk scores, researchers said.

As a result, the new tests are better at calibrating a person’s genetic risk score to their particular ancestry.

“We can’t fix all biases in the risk scores, but we can make sure that if a person is in a high-risk group for a disease, they’ll get identified as high-risk, regardless of what their genetic ancestry is,” Lennon said.

The researchers also evaluated scores that indicate a disease risk that could be lowered through medical treatment, screening to catch early illness or lifestyle changes like eating right, exercising and sleeping well.

“It was important that we weren’t giving people results that they couldn’t do anything about,” Lennon said.

The new study was published Feb. 19 in the journal Nature Medicine.

Follow-up studies will evaluate how well the scores predicted risk, and how risk scores might influence patients’ health care.

“Ultimately, the network wants to know what it means for a person to receive information that says they’re at high risk for one of these diseases,” Lennon said.

Gene Therapy Brings Hearing to Kids With Congenital Deafness,"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter

HealthDay

THURSDAY, Jan. 25, 2024 (HealthDay News) -- Five of six Chinese children born deaf due to a rare genetic defect now have the ability to hear, thanks to an experimental gene therapy.

The therapy involved a hollowed-out virus loaded with a healthy version of the gene responsible for producing otoferlin, a protein necessary for the transmission of sound signals from the inner ear to the brain.

Doctors injected the virus into the inner ears of the children through a special surgical procedure, and five of the kids experienced hearing recovery within six months.

“The results from this study are truly remarkable. We saw the hearing ability of children improve dramatically week by week, as well as the regaining of their speech,” said researcher Zheng-Yi Chen, an associate scientist in Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Harvard-affiliated Mass Eye and Ear in Boston.

Mass Eye and Ear researchers worked with doctors in China to treat the six children, with the trial taking place at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai.

These results bolster findings from a U.S.-based trial that cured otoferlin deafness in an 11-year-old Moroccan boy being treated at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The Chinese trial treated its first patient more than a year ago, in December 2022, and thus represents the first human clinical trial to administer gene therapy for otoferlin deafness, researchers said.

The Moroccan boy received his gene therapy in October in one ear. Within four months, his hearing improved enough that he now has only mild to moderate hearing loss in the treated ear, according to a CHOP news release.

“There’s no sound I don’t like,” patient Aissam Dam told the New York Times through an interpreter. “They’re all good.”

About one in 500 infants are born with or develop hearing loss during early childhood, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

More than 60% of hearing loss cases in children stem from genetic reasons, researchers said in background notes. Mutation of the otoferlin gene is one of those reasons for congenital deafness.

But because this condition is caused by a lack of the signaling protein, researchers had hoped it could be reversed with gene therapy.

About 200,000 people around the world are affected by otoferlin deafness, the Times reported.

All six children in the Chinese study had total deafness due to their otoferlin mutation, researchers said.

Within a half-year of treatment, five of the kids had demonstrated hearing recovery, dramatic improvements in their speech perception, and a restored ability to conduct normal conversation.

The treatment also produced no major side effects in the children, researchers said.

Researchers next plan to expand the trial to a larger sample size, and continue tracking treated kids to see how well they do.

“Not since cochlear implants were invented 60 years ago, has there been an effective treatment for deafness,” Chen said in a hospital news release. “This is a huge milestone that symbolizes a new era in the fight against all types of hearing loss.”

The new study was published Jan. 24 in The Lancet journal.

Researchers from both the United States and Chinese trials plan to present their findings early next month at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology.
